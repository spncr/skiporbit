This is a prototype/experiment for a space delivery game.

The main goal is to have fun, agile controls and the ability to slingshot
between gravity fields.

I'm trying to avoid having a gun on your own ship, but I can imagine there might
be enemies that shoot at you.

Right now the goals are:
1) Make flying fun
2) Figure out how to make sense of the space, the edges need to loop or
be dangerous
3) Add planets to fly around/be affected by


Ideas:
* Thruster that you charge, release to boost
* The closer you get to a planet, the more "energy" you get (so boosts are stronger?)
* Smoke, clunky space junk feel
* Planets that are really huge
* Visual information:
  * charging boost (thruster of some sort)
  * planet forces (maybe a small arrow, showing the pull?)
  * orbital path?
  * goal
* Landing means you have to hit the planet at a very low velocity, light like a butterfly
* Parallax background layers, fun to look at
